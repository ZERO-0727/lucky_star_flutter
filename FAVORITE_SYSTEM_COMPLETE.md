## 🔁 Full Favorite Logic Requirements - Implementation Details

### 1. ✅ From Wish/Experience Browse Pages and Detail Pages
**Requirement**: When the user taps the star icon on a wish or experience card (either from the browse page or the detail page), the item must be:
- ✅ Saved to the appropriate favorite array in Firestore: `favorite_wishes` or `favorite_experiences`
- ✅ Reflected immediately in the homepage favorite section (horizontal scroll)

**Implementation**:
- **Browse Pages** (`lib/wish_wall_screen.dart`): Implemented full favorite tracking with `_wishFavoriteStates` and `_experienceFavoriteStates` maps
- **Detail Pages** (`lib/wish_detail_screen.dart`, `lib/experience_detail_screen.dart`): Already have `_toggleFavorite()` methods with Firestore updates
- **Widget Cards** (`lib/widgets/wish_card.dart`, `lib/widgets/experience_card.dart`): Updated to sync with parent state using `didUpdateWidget()` 
- **Homepage** (`lib/home_screen.dart`): Automatically refreshes when returning from detail pages via `.then((_) => _loadFavoriteWishes())`

### 2. ✅ Homepage Behavior - Cancel Favorite (Star Unchecked)
**Requirement**: If the user clicks the star icon to unfavorite a wish or experience on the homepage scroll section, the item must:
- ✅ Be removed immediately from the list
- ✅ Trigger a forced refresh of the homepage UI to reflect the change

**Implementation**:
- **Homepage** (`lib/home_screen.dart`): 
  - `_unfavoriteWishFromHomepage()` method removes item immediately from `_favoriteWishes` list
  - `_unfavoriteExperienceFromHomepage()` method removes item immediately from `_favoriteExperiences` list
  - Both methods update Firestore and provide user feedback via SnackBar

### 3. ✅ View All Pages - Cancel Favorite Behavior
**Requirement**: When a user unfavorites a wish or experience from the "View All" page:
- ✅ The item may remain visible temporarily in the list (non-intrusive)
- ✅ But the Firestore backend must be updated immediately to reflect the unfavorite
- ✅ If the user taps the star again to favorite it again, it must be added back to Firestore immediately and show updated star state in the UI

**Implementation**:
- **All Favorite Pages** (`lib/all_favorite_wishes_page.dart`, `lib/all_favorite_experiences_page.dart`):
  - Use `_localFavoriteStates` map for non-intrusive UI updates
  - `_onFavoriteToggle()` methods update Firestore immediately in background
  - Items remain visible but show correct star state
  - Error handling with state reversion if Firestore update fails

### 4. ✅ Homepage Return Behavior
**Requirement**: When the user navigates back from the "View All" page, the homepage must:
- ✅ Automatically refresh
- ✅ Reflect the current Firestore favorite state for both wishes and experiences

**Implementation**:
- **Homepage** (`lib/home_screen.dart`):
  - `_refreshHomeData()` method called when returning from "View All" pages
  - Uses `.then((_) => _refreshHomeData())` on navigation returns
  - Reloads all favorite data from Firestore to ensure consistency
