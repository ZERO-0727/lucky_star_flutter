# Debugging: Blank Screen on Launch (Flutter Web)

## Task Description
After setting up the main navigation with five tabs (Home, Plaza, Wish Wall, User Plaza, Chat), the app compiles and launches in Chrome without errors. However, the screen remains completely blank (white screen), and no UI is visible.

## What We've Verified
- main.dart is correctly pointing to LuckyStarApp(), which sets MainNavigation() as the home.
- All screens are defined as separate widgets and imported.
- The browser loads the page (localhost:60694) but nothing is rendered.

## Possible Causes
- MainNavigation may be returning an empty widget or missing Scaffold.
- Tab content widgets may not be returning anything inside their build methods.
- There may be a misconfiguration in routing or MaterialApp structure.

## Next Steps
1. Check the browser console for CORS errors (since we're making API calls)
2. Verify that all screen widgets return valid UI components
3. Add temporary debug messages to track app initialization
4. Test navigation between tabs to isolate the issue

## Temporary Debug Measures Implemented
1. Added CORS header to API requests in chat_screen.dart
2. Created a temporary splash screen in main.dart to verify app initialization
3. Added debug console logging via `flutter run -d chrome --verbose`
