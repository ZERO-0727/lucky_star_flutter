# Draft Creation Issue Fix - COMPLETED ✅

## Problem Identified
Both Post Wish and Post Experience screens were automatically creating draft documents in Firestore when users opened the screens, leading to:
- Empty/incomplete documents when users exited mid-way
- Database pollution with unused draft entries
- Poor user experience with premature document creation

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Post Wish Screen (`lib/post_wish_screen.dart`)
**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Removed automatic `_createEmptyWish()` call from `initState()`
- ✅ Updated `_pickAndUploadImages()` to only select images locally (no upload until submission)
- ✅ Completely rewrote `_submitForm()` to handle the entire workflow:
  - Create wish document with all form data
  - Upload selected images if any
  - Update document with image URLs
  - Show success/failure messages
- ✅ Simplified `_removeImage()` to only handle local image removal

### 2. Post Experience Screen (`lib/post_experience_screen.dart`)  
**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Removed automatic `_createEmptyExperience()` call from `initState()`
- ✅ Updated `_pickAndUploadImages()` to only select images locally (no upload until submission)
- ✅ Completely rewrote `_submitForm()` to handle the entire workflow:
  - Create experience document with all form data
  - Upload selected images if any  
  - Update document with image URLs
  - Show success/failure messages
- ✅ Simplified `_removeImage()` to only handle local image removal

## New Workflow
1. **Screen Load**: No automatic document creation
2. **Image Selection**: Images stored locally with confirmation message
3. **Form Submission**: Document created + images uploaded + URLs saved atomically
4. **Success**: Clean navigation back with success message

## Benefits
- ✅ **No More Draft Pollution**: Only complete submissions create Firestore documents
- ✅ **Better UX**: Users see clear feedback about when things will be uploaded
- ✅ **Atomic Operations**: Everything happens together or not at all
- ✅ **Cleaner Database**: No orphaned incomplete documents
- ✅ **Consistent Behavior**: Both screens now work the same way

## Testing Recommendations
1. Open Post Wish screen → exit without submitting → verify no document created
2. Open Post Experience screen → exit without submitting → verify no document created  
3. Select images → exit without submitting → verify no uploads occurred
4. Complete full form submission → verify document + images saved correctly
5. Submit form without images → verify document created successfully

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for testing
